# Basic Calculator  

I tried building a basic calculator to improve my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project helped me understand UI design, event handling, and keyboard support.  

## Features  
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (**+, -, *, /, %**)  
- Supports both **button clicks and keyboard inputs**  
- **Responsive design** with a clean UI  
- **AC (Clear) and DEL (Delete) functions**  

## How to Use  
- Click the buttons or use your **keyboard** for calculations.  
- Press **Enter** for `=` and **Backspace** for `DEL`.
  
## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayakrishna77/Calculator.git
2. Open index.html in your browser.

   

## Screenshot 
Below is a screenshot of the calculator.
